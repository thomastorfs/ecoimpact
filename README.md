# Project codename "Eco Impact"



***This project is a work in progress.***



The idea behind Eco Impact is to create a means of showing how simple decisions in someone's life can have a certain ecological impact. It ranges from buying products to personal transport, housing, heating, etcetera. These elements are visualized by presenting the parts from which the subject is made of, each with their individual impact.

The application needs to show information on multiple levels depending on the domain or the granularity of the question. The user of the application has a specific goal when gaining information. For example, some users may want to make a quick decision between 2 choices by comparing the corresponding information sheets. Others may want to map their total ecological footprint or a subdomain.

The initial proof of concept encompasses the domain of physical products. Provided there is sufficient data, it is possible to make recommendations in order to increase ecological awareness and to create an incentive to slowly but surely apply a more ecological way of life.

This project will start by building and visualizing a small database of physical products. The analysis applies concepts of Domain-Driven Design, Behaviour-Driven Development and Event Sourcing. The technical implementation will contain the first components of a microservice architecture in combination with a simple and visually strong frontend.
